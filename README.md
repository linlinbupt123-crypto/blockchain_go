Learning Project: Go Blockchain

This project is based on the Go Blockchain course

The original course code can be found here

The basic blockchain principles remain unchanged. This code was originally written for Go 1.13, and some libraries are incompatible with newer Go versions. Minor modifications have been made to ensure compatibility while preserving the original work.
